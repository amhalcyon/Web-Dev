        <p><strong>Step 1: </strong> Put the spices, garlic and oil in a large bowl and mix well. Add the chicken and turn in the mixture until well coated. Heat a large non-stick pan that has a lid, then fry the chicken, uncovered (without extra oil) over a medium-high heat for 5 mins until browned, turning the chicken halfway to brown on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside on a plate.<br>
        <strong>Step 2: </strong>Pour the bouillon into the pan, stirring well to incorporate any garlicky bits that may have stuck to the base of the pan, then stir in the rice, leeks, oregano or thyme and bay, if using. Lay the chicken on top, then cover the pan and bring to the boil. Turn down the heat and simmer for 20 mins.<br>
        <strong>Step 3: </strong> Stir in the frozen vegetables, then cover and simmer for about 5 mins to heat through. Leave to stand for about 5-10 mins, then lightly mix and serve.<br>

        <p><strong>Step 1: </strong> Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.<br>
        <strong>Step 2: </strong> Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.<br>
        <strong>Step 3 </strong> Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.<br>
        <strong>Step 4: </strong> Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.<br>
